Describe your overall impressions and your recommendation, including changes or revisions. Please note that you should pay attention to scientific, methodological, and ethical soundness only, not novelty, topicality, or scope. A checklist of things to you may want to consider is below:
 - Are the methodologies used appropriate?
 - Are any methodological weaknesses addressed?
 - Is all statistical analysis sound?
 - Does the conclusion (if present) reflect the argument, is it supported by data/facts?
 - Is the article logically structured, succinct, and does the argument flow coherently?
 - Are the references adequate and appropriate? *

This is a re-review of the Stage 1 Registered Report by the authors. I
use the responses to my feedback from the original review to guide my
re-review; I did not read the other reviewer's comments and
responses. My original assessment of the manuscript was

> "I think this project is well thought out, but requires additional
> explication of data extraction protocols and substantial improvement
> of the data analysis plan. I am happy the authors submitted a RR1
> and hope my comments may help improve the project."

I stand by that statement, except that the authors made substantial
improvements :) What follows are improvements that the authors can
still make.

My main comment is that the hypotheses are still open to flexibility
in the analyses and does not incorporate the scope conditions or lack
of scope. There are still a lot of hypotheses regarding relations
between variables that may or may not be conditional on covariates
now. The hypotheses could clearly state they're without controls or
which controls, which also doesn't become clear in the data analysis
plan. Especially given the amount of variables that are being coded, I
would consider it important to see that.

Other minor things include:
+ The '#' wildcard is non-standard, so I would recommend to include a
short explanation of that for the reader in a next version.
+ The authors do not have to feel obliged to cite my documentation
work they're using as an example :)
+ A bit nitpicking but important: "The extracted study effect sizes
  will be converted to z scores" really needs to read Fisher's Z,
  because it is not equivalent
+ More information on the funnel plots when there is heterogeneity can
  be found in either isbn:9781119964377 or isbn:9780470870150, but I
  don't have them at hand and am not 100% sure. If the authors need a
  copy, they can reach out to me at chris@libscie.org
