## Summary
The manuscript proposes a randomly assigned experiment where the effect of immediate response-dependent feedback affects performance on quizzes (i.e., quiz-based learning). More specifically, it focuses on 2 feedback conditions and a control group which only includes proportion correct responses. I split my comments on the manuscript per domain below.

## Hypotheses
The hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 2a, 2b are clearly formulated. However, I would like to suggest that the authors apply ordered hypothesis testing to increase the statistical power of the tests, because their hypotheses clearly indicate that they are interested in the ordering of the groups' performance (Hypothesis 1a/b) and certainty (Hypothesis 2a/b). For this, I recommend using the software provided at http://www.fss.uu.nl/pubs/rmkuiper/Comparison%20Of%20Means%20with%20Interface.zip on a Windows machine. This is very easy to use software and provides you with an easy way to test these ordered hypotheses.

Note that if you do not test the ordered groups with one comprehensive hypothesis, you technically need 3 hypotheses to fully make this statement and increase the risk of false positives. The current setup is therefore incomplete to answer these research questions. If you compare KCRF-NF (1a and 2a) and AIF-KCRF (1b and 2b) you need to test the difference between AIF-NF as well (transitivity does not apply with statistical testing). As noted before, I strongly recommend preventing this entire problem alltogether by using ordered hypothesis testing (i.e., AIF > KCRF > NF).

## Research Questions

The research questions at the end of the introduction come out of the blue, for me, and are presented as the only research questions despite being exploratory. There is now no research question with respect to the effect of feedback on certainty and performance, which are THE research question, right? Please clarify.

## Power analyses

Even though I am glad the author(s) do a formal power analysis, I am unconvinced by the .8 SMD difference the power analysis is based on. I inspected the original meta-analysis (Azevedo & Bernard, 1995), which contains many small samples and much variation in the found effect sizes. The largest effect is d = 2.12 whereas the smallest is d = .03; the median of the effects is around d = .5. I strongly recommend that the power analyses are adjusted to take into account these small studies, which bias the effect size estimate upward through publication bias, and the large amount of observed variation in the effects. I would recommended using a smaller effect as the population estimate for this study and tend to be more conservative than liberal (i.e., I suggest something around d = .3).

## Measures
The method section (p8) states that certain demographical data are collected, but nowhere their intended use is stated (also not in the hypotheses). Are these covariates for the analyses or are they not? Please specify explicitly such that each variable is accounted for (this ensures that it is clear which variables are a priori defined as covariates)

Also, on p8 it states a pilot study is conducted to select 20 questions from a pool of 40 based on similarity. Please specify how this selection will take place. In what way will these results from the pilot study be analyzed to come to the final selection and what are the criteria for determining similarity?

Finally, how is the dependent variable certainty determined? I was unable to determine this based on the manuscript, except that there is one or more 5 likert items (p7 line 46), but I cannot find the questions themselves (also not in Hancock 1992). Please specify the materials and how the certainty score is determined (latent variable estimate; parcelling?).

## Conclusion

I am of the opinion that an ordered hypothesis test, which seems to be what the author(s) aim to test, is a valuable addition to the literature that raises a practical issue. If the issues I raise are clarified and resolved (especially testing the ordered hypothesis directly), I am confident that the outcomes of this study will prove worthwhile. I would like to thank the authors for submitting this as a preregistered report; these issues can now still be resolved whereas in a 'normal' review process these issues could not have and would have made me reject it.

## Minor things
1. "Exploratorily" should be "exploratively"
2. Figure 2 is unreadable in the current version. Please upgrade quality of image
