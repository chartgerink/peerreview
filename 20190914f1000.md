I read "The case for openness in engineering research" and found it to provide a good overview of the state of openness in general. 

My main remark for the authors is that I felt like I was familiar with the contents of the opinion piece, despite having zero knowledge about engineering research. Maybe the case for openness in engineering research is simply the case for openness, give a few field specific details? I'd expected more differentiation, given the statement that it would be focused on engineering. All in all, I found little to nothing to actively disagree with in respect to factual claims.

One particular aspect that might be specific to engineering research are patents. Public disclosure can preclude an invention from patenting, if it takes longer than 12 months for the patent to filed after initial public disclosure of the invention. However, patents are relatively rarely discussed in the open space compared to licensing, so I don't know whether this would fit in or not. It might also be relevant to refer the "Patent trolling" scenario to the authors for this.

Some minor aspects:
* In the "Accessibility:" paragraph, licensing isn't mentioned. For something to remain accessible, permissive licensing is necessary (otherwise it may disappear at any point)
* "Reproducibility:" helps understand, not enable, reproducibility in my perspective but I'm nitpicking (this is a good sign because there's hardly anything else to comment on)
* "Establish priority:" is a good section. I usually refer to this as the Scooping Paradox, which helps people remember. Never wrote it down, so if you like it, it's yours :)
* Regretfully, PeerJ preprints will stop accepting new preprints september 30th, which may (or may not) affect the authors' willingness to include it as a recommendation.
